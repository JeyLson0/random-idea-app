_Introduction to backend (node.js and express) and database (MongoDB and mongoose)_

## Functional fullstack app

1. client folder contains the following: API services (fetch backend), Webpack, Scripts and stylesheet

2. public folder contains bundled frontend

3. config contains secrets (.env) that is not pushed to github

4. Route contains express routing

5. Server.js contains express

6. models folder contains mongoose which create a schema

NOTE: this build is still not in production. Change webpack to production mode, use font awesome cdn, change API url in API service (add a proxy to webpack config).
